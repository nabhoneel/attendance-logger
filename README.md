# Attendance Logger

Super simple webapp to allow people to sign in and **let them say whether they'll be going to college, and put up a reason for going/not going** (stemmed from the daily conversations my friends and I had before going to college).

## Stuff used:

 - React (+Redux, for maintaining state) on the front
 - Node server (hosted on [Openode.io](https://www.openode.io/))
 - MongoDB (hosted on [mlab.com](https://www.mlab.com))
 - Oh, and sign in with Google OAuth2

Install locally with:

*First, cd into the project folder*

```
$ npm install
$ cd client
$ npm install
```
(will require an internet connection to connect to the dev version of mlab's MongoDB)
